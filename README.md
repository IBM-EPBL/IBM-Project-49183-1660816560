Project Description:
   Personalized Fashion Recommender system that generates recommendations for the user based on an input given. Unlike the conventional systems that rely on the user's previous purchases and history, this project aims at using an image of a product given as input by the user to generate recommendations since many-a-time people see something that they are interested in and tend to look for products that are similar to that. We use neural networks to process the images from Fashion Product Images Dataset and the Nearest neighbour backed recommender to generate the final recommendations.Chatbot is also used.
